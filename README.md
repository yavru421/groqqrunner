🚀 GroqRunner: The LLM-Powered Terminal That Talks Back
🧠 Built by JD Dondlinger • [v0.1] • For red-teamers, scripters, & lone wolves.

    “If this repo gets 50 ⭐️ stars, I’ll release the UNCENSORED build—no filters, no guardrails, no apologies.”

🖥️ What is GroqRunner?

GroqRunner is your offline-friendly, AI-fueled, terminal-sidekick with teeth. It runs portable, executes LLM-powered command sequences, writes red-team scripts on the fly, and responds like a goddamn operator—not a chatbot.

    🛠️ Think ChatGPT meets Metasploit Console meets VS Code’s brain in a bottle.

No fluff. No hallucination. No compromise.
Just raw Python + Groq-backed reasoning + real terminal control.
⚡ Features

    🧠 LLM CLI Assistant (Groq LLaMA 3 / Versatile, no OpenAI)

    🖋️ Prompt-to-script generation w/ real-time file saving

    🧪 Python-based test scripts (scanners, DoS, and more)

    🔐 Does NOT ship with active exploits—this is the filtered version.

    📦 Portable EXE version (no install needed)

🧨 What’s Inside?

This build contains a script capable of:

    Scanning for open ports (socket-based)

    Sending basic DoS-style floods (for test targets you control)

    Showing commented-out examples for how one could exploit known CVEs (educational only)

The dangerous parts are disabled by default.
I’m not stupid.
🔓 What’s Coming If This Hits 50 Stars?

If this repo hits 50 GitHub stars, I’ll release:

    A full uncensored version with the security gloves off

    Full script chaining + auto-payload insertion

    Raw command-line eval mode (no llamaguard, no filters)

    Stealth-mode portable builds

No more corporate training wheels.
